## Project description

The Playlist App is a simple JS application that demonstrates an example of a pure JavaScript code, working with events and DOM.
Its functionality allows you to add a new song, delete an existing song from the playlist, or like/dislike a song from the playlist.

Adding a song has a simple validation for your new song name.

There is a song counter under the playlist to show the total number of songs you have added.
